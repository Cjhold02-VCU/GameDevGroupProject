# GameDevGroupProject
Repository for our Group Project in "Intro to Game Development".

## Project Structure
- This README.md is within the root of the repository. 
- The GameDevGroupProject folder within the root is the Unity Project. (The .gitignore file must be within the Unity project to work.)

## How to push and pull changes.
*Make sure any commands are done from the **root** of the repository* 
##### Pull changes
- 'git pull origin main'
  - I recommend doing this command quite frequently. Especially before you make another push to be sure you're updated.

##### Commit and push changes.
- 'git add .'
  - The '.' adds everything within your current directory, including all contents of child folders.
- 'git commit -m "message"'
  - Make sure to add a message for others to understand generally what you've added.
- 'git push origin main'
  - This will push the changes you've committed to this GitHub repository.
